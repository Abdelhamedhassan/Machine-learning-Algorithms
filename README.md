# Heart Failure Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict heart failure using various machine learning algorithms. The dataset used for this analysis contains medical records of patients and includes several features such as age, blood pressure, and heart rate. The goal is to identify patients at risk of heart failure, enabling early intervention and treatment.

## Features

- **Heart Failure Prediction**: Predict the likelihood of heart failure using various machine learning models.
- **Clustering Algorithms**: Apply Hierarchical Clustering and K-Medoids for grouping similar patients based on their health features.
- **Fuzzy Logic**: Use fuzzy logic systems to handle uncertainty in data and improve prediction accuracy.
- **Classification Models**: Implement Logistic Regression and Decision Tree for predicting heart failure.
- **Data Visualizations**: Visualize the data and model results for better insights and analysis.

## Machine Learning Models Used

1. **Hierarchical Clustering**: A clustering algorithm that builds a hierarchy of clusters. Useful for identifying groups of similar patients.
2. **K-Medoids**: A clustering algorithm similar to K-means but more robust to outliers, used for segmenting patients based on their health data.
3. **Fuzzy Logic**: A system that models uncertainty and imprecision, allowing for more nuanced decision-making in predictions.
4. **Logistic Regression**: A statistical method for predicting binary outcomes (heart failure or not) based on medical features.
5. **Decision Tree**: A decision support tool that uses a tree-like model to make predictions based on feature values.

## Data Visualization

- **Correlation Heatmaps**: To visualize the relationships between different health features.
- **Feature Importance**: To identify the most significant features affecting the prediction of heart failure.
- **Clustering Visualizations**: For visualizing the result of clustering algorithms like Hierarchical Clustering and K-Medoids.
